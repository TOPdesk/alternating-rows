## Purpose
This project provides styles to be injected into TOPdesk by [the stylus browser extension](https://add0n.com/stylus.html). With this you can change the colors of every second row in a TOPdesk overview.

For full explanation, plus instructions on how to install and use, see [the homepage of this project](https://topdesk.github.io/alternating-rows/).

## Release an update
Make any changes in `public\topdesk-alternating-rows.user.css`, and remember to update the version number in the top of the file. Push the new file, and Stylus will update users automatically. Finally, create and push a version tag in git to accompany the version bump.
